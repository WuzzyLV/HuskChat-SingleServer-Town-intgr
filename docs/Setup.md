This will walk you through installing HuskChat on your Velocity or BungeeCord/Waterfall-based proxy server.

## Requirements
* Java 17+
* A Spigot (1.17.1+) Minecraft server (for single-server setups) OR a Velocity (recommended) or BungeeCord/Waterfall-based proxy server

> **Warning:** The Spigot plugin "NoChatReports" will not work with HuskChat. Use FreedomChat instead if you wish to eliminate chat report warnings.

## Single-server Setup Instructions
1. Turn off your Spigot server
2. Download the [latest version of HuskChat](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/HuskChat/releases/latest).
3. Add the jar file to your Spigot server's `~/plugins` folder
4. Start your Spigot server. Let HuskChat generate its [[config files]], then stop the server again.
5. Modify your HuskChat [[config files]] as needed, then start your Spigot server again.

## Multi-server Setup Instructions
